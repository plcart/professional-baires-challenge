If you are a cautious person, you might opt for a more expensive policy with better coverage. If you have a lot of assets, experts recommend that you get enough liability coverage to protect them; otherwise, the other party involved in an accident could sue and attempt to collect on those assets.</span>

                            <p>As parents, there are many ways we enjoy spending time with our children. Spending dozens, if
                                not hundreds, of hours sitting white- knuckled in the passenger seat while your student driver
                                practices merging onto a major highway isn’t even on the list. Trust us, we understand.</p>
                            <p>But according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, newly licensed drivers are
                                about eight times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes in their first six months than
                                more experienced drivers. The takeaway? Experience counts. The Center for Disease Control
                                suggests that increased education programs and parental involvement in instruction are associated
                                with reductions of as many as 40% of fatal and injury crashes among 16-year-olds.

                            <p>Most people (and even some dogs), are pretty excellent drivers with nothing but sunshine and
                                open roads. Inclement weather causes more than 1.5 million reported traffic accidents per
                                year, resulting in 673,000 injuries and 7,400 fatalities.</p>
                            <p>"Before they take their driver’s test, make sure your student drivers have experience in all
                                different types of weather and non-weather conditions,” says Monica Savioz of Edward Savioz

                                off, would you?), and an even better parent, how are you as a teacher? Many driving school
                                instructors have been teaching student drivers for decades, and we all know teenagers are
                                more likely to listen to literally anyone else than take instruction from their parents.</p>
                            <p>"Take a six hour behind-the-wheel course,” says Dave Urbanek of Urbanek’s Driving School. “The

                                they embrace, you can influence the way they drive.</p>
                            <p>"Teens are very likely to pick up the habits of their parents,” says J.C. Fawcett of the Defensive
                                Driving School. “A parent should think about. Do I cuss at other drivers while driving? Do
                                I speed? Do I tailgate? The training that comes from students observing their parents is
                                very powerful. If a parent attempts to change their habits only when their teen is learning
                                to drive, it's probably 10 years too late."</p>

                            <p>"Ask insurance companies what discounts are available to them to help reduce the high cost of

                            <p>"Many companies offer discounts for good grades and for completion of an approved driver’s education

                                "Some also have their own discount programs. State Farm, for example, has a program called
